# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on biomedical voice measurements.

##  Project Highlights:
- Used supervised machine learning algorithms like **SVM** to classify patient data.
- Achieved over **90% accuracy** using features from the UCI Parkinson's dataset.
- Performed data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.
- Visualized results using confusion matrix and classification report.

##  Tools Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Dataset:
UCI Parkinson's Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons

##  Goal:
Help in early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using AI-powered diagnostic tools.
